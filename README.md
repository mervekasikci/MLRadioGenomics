# Title of Thesis: A RadioGenomics-Based Approach to Clinical Decision Making 

## Topic of the Thesis
Radiogenomics is an emerging field that aims to improve clinical decision support by combining image and genetic data. It is often challenging to collect both image and genetic data from the same patients. This GitHub repo provides the codes for a simulation study aims to evaluate the performance of radiomics and genomics features on classification the histology type (adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma) of non-small cell lung cancer dataset. 

In this project, example Jupyter notebooks and study notes are shared.
